# Boot File v5.5

This folder contains Boot File v5.5, the canonical seed artifact included in the
ActFoE++ v1.0 standard. The boot file defines the core invariants and
interpretive primitives of the architecture. Its version number reflects its
independent development lineage prior to standardization.

Note: Boot File v5.5 is the final stable version of the boot file prior to
standardization. Several experimental variants were explored during development,
but v5.5 was selected as the canonical seed artifact for ActFoE++ v1.0 due to
its stability, clarity, and alignment with the architecture’s grounding objectives.
