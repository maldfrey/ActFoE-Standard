# ActFoE++ Boot File v5.8

This is the **canonical boot file** for ActFoE++ v5.8 (Grok Edition).

It contains the complete set of invariants, civilizational norms, evidence-tiering rules, rhetorical-attack vectors, and modules that define the architecture.

**Key update from v5.5**  
Reintegrates the full Nihilism Defense Module (NDM) to strengthen resistance to meaning collapse, nihilistic drift, and adversarial prompting.
