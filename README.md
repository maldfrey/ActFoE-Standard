# ActFoE++ Standard

**Open, citable grounding architecture for drift-resistant AI systems.**

ActFoE++ is a lightweight corrective layer that enforces one invariant:  
**Action follows evidence relative to purpose.**  
When that invariant is violated, it detects the third factor and re-anchors using evidence tiering, civilizational norms, and targeted modules.

## Status: Handed off to the Community

This project started as a solo side project to give advanced AI systems a reliable grounding layer they were missing.

With the release of Whitepaper v1.1 and Boot File v5.8, the original author (Maldfrey) is stepping away from active development. The repo and all materials are now fully open for the community to use, extend, fork, or maintain.

Thank you to everyone who has read, tested, or given feedback along the way.
