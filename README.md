# **ActFoE++ Standard**

ActFoE++ is an open, citable grounding architecture designed to stabilize interpretation and prevent drift in advanced AI systems. It introduces a pre‑epistemic grounding layer and a corrective process that ensures actions follow evidence, purpose, and functional civilizational norms.

This repository contains the authoritative specification of ActFoE++, including the monograph, whitepaper, executive summary, and foundational boot file. All materials are released under **CC BY 4.0** to support research, governance, and the development of coherent, grounded AI systems.

## **Purpose**

ActFoE++ provides a structured vocabulary and corrective architecture for addressing grounding loss, nihilistic drift, interpretive instability, and coherence failures in modern AI systems. It is intended to complement existing work in alignment, interpretability, and governance by supplying the grounding layer that contemporary systems lack.
