# ActFoE++ Living Appendix

This folder contains future clarifications, expansions, examples, and addenda  
related to the ActFoE++ standard. These materials supplement the v1.0 release  
without modifying the core documents.

For example, the following paired clarifications surface the contrast class  
between quantitative and qualitative properties that is fully developed in the  
monograph but only implicitly encoded in the boot file.

**Note:** The boot file included in the ActFoE++ v1.0 standard is Boot File v5.5,  
reflecting its independent development lineage prior to standardization.

## Clarification: Definition of “Quantitative”

In the v1.0 boot file, the distinction between qualitative and quantitative  
evidence is operationally encoded but not explicitly defined in prose. This is  
partly due to the context-length constraints under which the original boot file  
was authored, and partly due to the boot file’s role as a minimal,  
implementation-oriented seed rather than a conceptual glossary.

For clarity:

A quantitative property is one that can be divided by an agreed-upon standard,  
yielding a value expressed in those standard units.

The monograph provides the full conceptual treatment of this distinction; this  
appendix entry simply makes the implicit definition explicit for convenience.  
This clarification is consistent with the monograph and may be incorporated into  
a future optimization pass of the boot file.

## Clarification: Definition of “Qualitative”

In the v1.0 boot file, qualitative properties are referenced but not defined in  
explicit terms.

For clarity:

A qualitative property is one expressed in natural language terms (nouns,  
adjectives, verbs) whose meaning depends on shared interpretation rather than  
division by a standard unit.

This definition complements the quantitative clarification above and aligns with  
the monograph’s full treatment of qualitative criteria. As with the quantitative  
definition, this may be incorporated into a future optimization pass of the boot  
file.
